# Version Control Simulation

From this project, I feel that I started to be comfortable with git and navigating through repositories.

From creating a directory to initializing commit, to creating a new branch and adding files, jumping through branches and merging them back to main, to resolving conflicts during a merge.

Next, I would like to explore more of the pull command. Knowing that practicing git would be a dance between local and remote repositories.
